# Who Does What

## Mental Shift

![](different_work/different_work.png)

Instead of:

> Some workers take orders. Other workers process them.

Switch your mindset:

> * Taking orders is one kind of work.
> * Processing orders is another kind of work.
> * Available workers do any available work.

In this model, with two workers:

1. Worker A may take an order and send it for processing.
2. Worker B may finish processing an order and send it back to the counter.
3. Worker A may switch to do processing work, and receive its own request from step 1.
